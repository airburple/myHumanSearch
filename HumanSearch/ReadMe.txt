To run the selenium test run this project first and then run the 
Selenium Test project seperately. Firefox must be installed.

To get the data connection to show up uncomment the Web.config
connection string block, after running with this uncommented several times I 
ran into some bugs.

MODEL: I decided to not go with a one to many model with humans and interests.
I thought about changing this later in the project but making that change
was not time effecient.

ANGULARJS: I went with AngularJs to assist in the site, it made the most 
sense.
